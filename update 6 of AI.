\section{}
The first Artificial intelligence method used in the lower extremity as Intelligence 
prosthesis which is a knee joint that replace the hydraulic mechanism by 
combination of microprocessor controlled and hydraulic or pneumatic actuator.
The microprocessor as name suggests process the signal received by the first 
sensor known as knee angle sensor provides information about the knee’s angle 
of flexion and extension and velocity of lateral and angular movement, unlike the 
human body, the sensor determines the direction of movement because of a 
magnetic implant and second sensor gathers information about weight 
placement.
Microprocessor receives the data or signals by the motion employed by the 
amputee and that data are analyzed and interpret to get the closer 
approximation to natural gait. This data provides information to the 
microprocessor about the device’s position and the extent of its motion, which 
are essentially proprioceptive sensations. The data are stored in the memory of 
the microprocessor for the future use like a recurrent neural network (RNN). A 
series of wire networks which are similar in function to the body’s nervous 
system. That is, it enables the sensors, microprocessor, servo motors, and 
hydraulic cylinder to communicate with each other. These networks connect the 
two sensors to the microprocessor, which transmits sensory data much like the 
ascending sensory pathways send information to the brain. The wires exiting the 
microprocessor leading to the servo motors carry “motion commands,” 
mimicking the descending motor pathways which instruct muscles to contract 
and produce a desired movement.
As in the human nervous system, these wires are dedicated to specific 
communication circuits between the sensors, microprocessor, servo motors, and 
hydraulics. This computed data are used to control the resistance generated by 
the hydraulic cylinders through the small valve passes into and out of the 
cylinder which regulate extension and flexion of the knee joint in different sub 
phases of gait cycle. It controls knee joint motion from 0° to maximum 60-700. 
This mechanism helps the amputee to do various activities like stair climbing, 
jogging, running and walking in uneven terrain.
The microprocessor knee joint uses various algorithms to achieve gait symmetry, 
motion analysis, stumble control and comfort. These algorithm are control logic, 
Intent detection algorithm, Genetic algorithm, Fuzzy logic based classifier, 
Expectation maximization algorithm and Impedance control algorithm . The 
Prosthetic knee joints uses this microprocessor control mechanism with machine

developed in 2014 by Baojun Chen et al., which adapt the amputee to walk on 
slope with different angles. The combination of myoelectric and intrinsic 
controller reduces the fatigue of muscle and attention during walking . The 
prototype design of prosthesis. Apart from EMG Control lower extremity 
prosthesis can be controlled by EEG signal using BCI, the example of EEG based 
control prosthesis is BiOM.
Lower Extremity Orthosis is a supportive device to the patients those have lost 
their function due to traumatic, neurologic and congenital abnormalities. The 
working principle of the Orthosis for the patient like hemiplegia, paraplegia and 
traumatic brain injury is changed vigorously with the implementation of artificial 
intelligence like functional electrical stimulation, Brain computer Interface and 
myoelectric controller. The concept of machine learning implemented in some 
sensor embedded stance control Orthosis which help the paraplegic to achieve 
near to normal gait with some limitations. The concept of functional electrical 
stimulation (FES) started in the year of 1960. This is used in case of damage of 
brain or spinal cord, stroke, Multiple Sclerosis (MS) and cerebral palsy.
The Functional electrical stimulation (FES) is the application of electrical stimulus 
to a paralyzed nerve or muscle to restore or achieve function. FES is most often 
used in neuro rehabilitation and is routinely paired with task-specific practice. 
Neuroprosthesis is a common example in orthotic substitution. Control system 
can be open loop or Feed forward control, closed-loop or Feed backward control 
and adaptive control can be applied to both Feed forward and Feed backward 
controller. In open-loop controlled FES, the electrical stimulator controls the 
output and closed-loop FES employs joint or muscle position sensors to facilitate 
greater responsiveness to muscle fatigue, or to irregularities in the environment.
